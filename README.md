# Template repository
 
This repository is marked as a repository template, and should be used when creating new repositories in the fiaas organisation.

When doing so, the files in this repo are copied to your new repository. Any further updates will need to be made directly in your repository.

## Included files

`.github/CODEOWNERS`: Defines @fiaas/maintainers as owners of all code
`.github/settings.yml`: Default repository [settings](https://github.com/probot/settings). Inherits from settings in our [community settings repository](https://github.com/fiaas/.github).
